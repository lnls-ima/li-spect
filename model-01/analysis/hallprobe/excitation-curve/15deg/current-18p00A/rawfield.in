# fma_rawfield.py input file
# Accelerator Physics LNLS
# ==========================

# --- Summary ---
#
# this is the input file for fma_rawfield.py script
# this script reads a fieldmap from a 3D magnet model, stores it
# for latter analysis and prints and plots basic information on the
# field map. It is used to quickly inspect the fieldmap


# --- Input parameters ---

# each analysis has an identity label used for naming output files

  config_label             'meas'


# the next parameter specifies the type of magnet to be analysis.
# each type may have its own particular algorithms to be applied

  magnet_type              'dipole'


# the full name of the file that contains the field map

  fmap_filename            '../../../../../measurement/magnetic/hallprobe/fmap-current-4p15A/Magnet_out_Spectrometro.dat'

# transformations
# [-2281.1 G is the central field of the original measured fieldmap]

  transform_refactor   -1.0 * (-9.728603e+03/-2281.1)   # invert field polarity
  transform_roty180    True   # rotation around y direction

# Runge-kutta algorithm used for the integration of the eqs. of motion needs to know
# what to do when trajectory reaches the fieldmap bounds. It will either extrapolate the field
# along the longitudinal (z) direction or consider it to have vanished. This is controlled with
# the parameter below. Bear in mind that the calculation of extrapolation coefficients is currently
# very time-consuming. As for the transverse directions (x and y), the RK algorithm will
# generate exceptions.

  not_raise_range_exceptions True
  fmap_extrapolation_flag  False
